All files contained herein were either from, or based upon the exercises and examples from the K&R C book. 

All .c source files in `cc/` were created verbatim and were tested for compilation using `ape/cc` in Plan 9. Linux and Mac OS X should be capable of compilation using a `cc` style C compiler, but with warnings.

All .c source files in `plan9/` were written for the Plan 9 6c compiler, but will most likely compile under 8c.

All .c source files in `clang/` were written to compile with minimal to no errors for clang on x86_64 GNU/Linux.
